# eWellnessFi React.js Application Readme [See me on YouTube](https://www.google.com)

This is a guide for setting up and running the React.js application using Visual Studio Code.

Let us understand the problem statement. In large multinational companies, what we noticed is that most of the employees are becoming physically inactive and are also mentally not so strong because of the work demands and long working hours.

There are multiple schemes devised by the corporate providing slight financial benefits however, they are not very impactful. 
eWellnessFi is a MOBILE APP connected to Google fit, where employers can add reward money as Solana Tokens and based on physical achievements like the number of steps and movements, the employees claims benefits in Solana. eWellnessFi is live connected to smart devices like apple watch, google fit to ensure we collect accurate data to incentivize.

Our primary differentiator is a Solana-powered gaming and rewarding application. Psychologically we realized Crypto rewards are more satisfying compared to traditional local  currencies of the same value and hence the power of our app. Solana will become our new measure of fitness to compare.

This is our implementation Framework. we have leveraged Solana Account API,Mint Token API, Send Token API And Check Balance API. The complete  application is developed using react js.
